## Day 1

The first challenge wants to get you familiar with different frameworks.

Going to the site attached to the challenge we are presented with a puzzle, you can complete it just using basic table puzzle solving skills but the correct answer is the steps in the first stage of the Unified Kill Chain framework:

    Reconnaissance -> Weaponisation -> Delivery -> Social Engineering -> Exploitation -> Persistence -> Defence Evasion -> Command and Control

It then takes you to another puzzle and the answer is stage 2 of the Unified Kill Chain framework:
  
    Pivoting -> Discovery -> Privilege Escalation -> Execution -> Credential Access -> Lateral Movement

Finally it takes you to a third puzzle where the answer is stage 3 of the Unified Kill Chain framework:
    
    Access -> Collection -> Exfiltration -> Impact -> Objectives
 
 This gives us the answer for both questions:
  
  *Who is the adversary that attacked Santa's network this year?* The Bandit Yeti<br>
  *What's the flag that they left behind?* THM{IT'S A Y3T1 CHR1$TMA$}
